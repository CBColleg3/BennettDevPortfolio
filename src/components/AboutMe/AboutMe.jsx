      <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
      <div>
      I've been programming probably since I was 10, it all started with me aspiring to make my own games, this lead to countless tutorials on how to get started on programming 
      and here we are. One college degree later in computer science and programming is now my favorite thing to do, there are so many things you can learn and still be wanting 
      to know more, the opportunities involved with coding is endless and I'm here for it!
