Once you save all of the islanders you can return home and end in a victory screen!"

    Paragraph2: "Buccaneer Brawl was all about algorithmic function coded into a 2D Fighter, before the round begins each player would need to type out a list of attacks the pirate will use before the battle. During the match, each pirate will perform the actions given by the players sequentially until they run out of commands and start from the beginning. Victory is obtained through the player who utilizes the best step-by-step instructions to defeat the other player, similar to how algorithms run sequentially in code and how debugging works with knowing what line of code goes where."

    Paragraph2: "Escape from the Sun was a personal learning experience during my early years of exploring programming. The game began as a test for a high school project, but over time, I realized it had the potential to become something greater. I frequently updated the game, even though the project was often lost due to my older laptops breaking down. These setbacks pushed me to create new prototypes, each improving the gameplay and helping me grow as a game designer. After developing 3â€“4 iterations of the game, I finally released the completed version on Steam in 2023."
